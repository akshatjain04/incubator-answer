/*
Test generated by RoostGPT for test functional-filter-test using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roost-gpt4-32k

Test Scenarios:

1. Positive scenario where proper Object ID is provided and showVote is true.
2. Positive scenario where proper Object ID is provided and showVote is false.
3. Negative scenario where an invalid Object ID is provided and showVote is true.
4. Negative scenario where an invalid Object ID is provided and showVote is false.
5. Scenario where the Object ID provided is null and showVote is true.
6. Scenario where the Object ID provided is null and showVote is false.
7. Scenario where the Object ID does not have any activities associated with it.
8. Test if descending sorting order by "id" is working as expected in the returned activity list.
9. Test if the function handles an error when there is an issue with the database (simulate a database connectivity issue).
10. Scenario where the "NotIn" function with activity type is working as expected when showVote is false.
11. Scenario where "NotIn" function is not invoked when showVote is true (since there is no need to filter out votes).
12. Scenario for checking if function handles an error properly when the getAllActivityType method fails (maybe simulate this during testing).
13. Test to ensure the method returns a meaningful error when it fails to retrieve activities for a given Object ID.
14. Scenario to check if an error is returned when cache is not initialized or available.
15. Scenarios to test the correct handling of context such as context timeouts or cancellations.
